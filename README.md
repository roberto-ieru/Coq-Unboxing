# A formal model for Lua and Pallene: Proofs for the paper *Unboxing Lua*.

To check all proofs, simply run `make` or `make all`.

All files were tested with Coq versions 8.16.1 and 8.17.0.
It doesn't work with 8.18 yet.

The file `index.md` has an index linking each definition in the paper to
its corresponding Coq definition. This index is generated automatically
by the script `coqrefs.lua`.
